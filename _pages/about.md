I am a third-year PhD student in the [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Program and the [CSE Department](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/anqiwuresearch). My current research interest lies in Probabilistic Machine Learning with its applications in Computational Neuroscience. More specifically, the modeling topics of my research span on: Diffusion (Probabilistic) Models, Variational Autoencoder, Bayesian inference, and Importance Sampling. I received my Master's and Bachelorâ€™s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Computer Software Engineering.
