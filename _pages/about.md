I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Program](https://ml.gatech.edu/) and the [CSE Department](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech (GaTech). My advisor is [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/pi). I obtained my Master's and B.Eng.'s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Software Engineering. I also spent time as a research intern at Meta and Alibaba.

##### Research Interests

My ML research focuses on deep generative models and time-series analysis, with their applications in computational neuroscience. Working with multivariate time-series data, I develop ML algorithms to infer semantically or scientifically meaningful latent structures and dynamics through advanced generative modeling approaches (e.g., diffusion models, disentangled variational auto-encoder).

<!-- * In neuroscience, my research aim is to discover scientifically meaningful neural latent encodings and dynamics through advanced generative modeling approaches (e.g., disentangled variational auto-encoder, video diffusion models).  -->

 <!-- More specifically, the modeling topics of my research span on: Diffusion (Probabilistic) Models, Variational Autoencoder, Bayesian inference, and Importance Sampling. -->

I am open to collaborate! ðŸ’¡ Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested!
