I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Program](https://ml.gatech.edu/) and the [CSE Department](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech (GaTech). My advisor is [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/anqiwuresearch). I obtained my Master's and B.Eng.'s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Computer Software Engineering. I also spent time as a research intern at ByteDance and Alibaba.

##### Research Topics

My Research Interest is centered on probabilistic machine learning, with its applications in computational neuroscience.
More specifically, my ML research focuses on the intersection of (deep) generative models and sequence modeling. Working with multivariate time-series data, I develop ML algorithms to infer semantically or scientifically meaningful latent structures and dynamics through advanced generative modeling approaches (e.g., disentangled variational auto-encoder, video diffusion models).

 <!-- More specifically, the modeling topics of my research span on: Diffusion (Probabilistic) Models, Variational Autoencoder, Bayesian inference, and Importance Sampling. -->

I am open to collaborateðŸ’¡! Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested!
