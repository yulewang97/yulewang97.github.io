Email: [yulewang@gatech.edu](mailto:yulewang@gatech.edu)

I am a fourth-year [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Ph.D. student in the [CSE Department](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech (GaTech). My advisor is [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/pi). I obtained my Master's and B.Eng.'s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Software Engineering. I also have worked as a research intern at Meta and Alibaba.

##### Research Interests

My ML research focuses on diffusion models and time-series analysis, with their applications in computational neuroscience. I develop ML methods to infer semantically meaningful latent structures and dynamics from multivariate neural time-series data. Previously, during my master’s studies, I also worked on recommender systems research.

<!-- * In neuroscience, my research aim is to discover scientifically meaningful neural latent encodings and dynamics through advanced generative modeling approaches (e.g., disentangled variational auto-encoder, video diffusion models).  -->

<!-- My ML research mainly focuses on the intersection of generative models and sequence modeling. Working with high-dimensional time-series data, I develop ML models to infer semantically or scientifically meaningful latent structures and dynamics through advanced generative modeling approaches (e.g., disentangled variational auto-encoder, video diffusion models).  -->
