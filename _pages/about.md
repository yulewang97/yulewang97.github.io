I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/) Program and the [CSE Department](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech (GaTech). My advisor is Prof. [Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/anqiwuresearch). My current research interest lies in Probabilistic Machine Learning with its applications in Computational Neuroscience. More specifically, the modeling topics of my research span on: Diffusion (Probabilistic) Models, Variational Autoencoder, Bayesian inference, and Importance Sampling. I received my Master's and B.Eng.'s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Computer Software Engineering.


I am open to collaborate ðŸ’¡!
