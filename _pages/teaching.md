Our group project focused on enhancing the Anki study experience by integrating AI and collaborative features to boost motivation and efficiency. We introduced a user study analytics tool that uses AI to interpret complex study statistics and provide personalized insights, helping users focus on areas that need improvement. We proposed an AI-based study scheduler that adapts review timing based on user performance, making learning more effective. The prototype also includes a shared deck feature, allowing multiple users to collaborate and edit flashcards in real timeâ€”ideal for study groups. We implemented an AI-generated deck tool, where users can upload notes and automatically receive organized flashcards for review. This user-centered design applies learning science principles and smart technology to create a more interactive and supportive study environment.

My final project focuses on introducing graduate STEM students to core concepts in computational neuroscience through a web-based interactive learning app. The goal is to help learners understand how the brain works and apply those insights to improve their own study habits and well-being. I conducted user interviews with three students in neuroscience and related fields. Their feedback highlighted the importance of high-quality visuals, deeper scientific content for advanced users, and relatable real-life examples. My design is influenced by platforms like Anki, Duolingo, and Khan Academy, and is guided by learning science principles such as prior knowledge activation, motivation through relevance, and active learning strategies.
